# Weather PY

Weather PY is a project that analyzes and visualizes weather data from various random cities around the world. It includes two main notebooks: `WeatherPy` and `VacationPy`. The project also includes API key management and output data handling.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scipy`
  - `requests`
  - `hvplot.pandas`
    

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-py.git
    cd weather-py
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy requests
    ```

3. Set up your API keys:
    - Create a file named `api_keys.py` in the root directory.
    - Add your API keys in the following format:
        ```python
        weather_api_key = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
        g_key = "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
        ```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook In VS or Jupyter notebook
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    - Open `WeatherPy.ipynb` to analyze weather data.
    - Open `VacationPy.ipynb` to analyze vacation destination data.

## Usage

### WeatherPy Notebook

The `WeatherPy.ipynb` notebook performs the following tasks:
1. **Data Retrieval**: Fetches current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for a list of random cities.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleans and organizes the data for analysis.
3. **Visualization**: Generates scatter plots to visualize:
    - Latitude vs. Temperature
    - Latitude vs. Humidity
    - Latitude vs. Cloudiness
    - Latitude vs. Wind Speed
4. **Linear Regression**: Analyzes correlations between latitude and the various weather parameters for both Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

### VacationPy Notebook

The `VacationPy.ipynb` notebook performs the following tasks:
1. **Data Retrieval**: Uses the cleaned weather data from `WeatherPy.ipynb`.
2. **Filtering**: Filters cities based on ideal weather conditions for vacation (e.g., temperature range, low humidity).
3. **Visualization**: Uses Geoapify to visualize hotel locations in the selected cities on a map.

## Results

The project generates several visualizations and performs linear regression analysis to identify correlations between latitude and various weather parameters.
